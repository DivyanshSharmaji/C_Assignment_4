Solutions of Assignment 4 :-

Ans.1 :- C program to print Hello Students on the screen :
		#include<stdio.h>
		main(){
			printf("Hello Students");
		}

Ans.2 :- C program to print Hello on the first line and Students in the second line :
		#include<stdio.h>
		main(){
			printf("Hello\nStudents");
		}

Ans.3 :- C program to print "MySirG" on the screen :
		#include<stdio.h>
		main(){
			printf("\"MySirG\"");
		}

Ans.4 :- C program to print "Teacher's Day" on the screen :
		#include<stdio.h>
		main(){
			printf("\"Teacher's Day\"");
		}

Ans.5 :- C program to print \n on the screen :
		#include<stdio.h>
		main(){
			printf("\\n");
		}

Ans.6 :- C program to print %d on the screen :
		#include<stdio.h>
		main(){
			printf("%%d");
		}

Ans.7 :- C program to print 3 values on the screen :
		#include<stdio.h>
		main(){
			int a = 1325;
			char c = 'A';
			float f = 1.3f;
			printf("a = %d, c = %c, f = %f",a,c,f);
		}

Ans.8 :- %i --> It is used to print/output the integer values on the screen. It works very similar to %d which is used to output decimal numbers.
	   %g --> It is used to print the decimal floating-point values, and it uses the fixed precision, i.e., the value after the decimal in input would be exactly the same as the value 
		    in the output.
	   %lf --> It is used to print the real values on the screen with a higher precision usually double than a float.

Ans.9 :- C program to print a character with its ASCII code :
		#include<stdio.h>
		main(){
			char ch = 'A';
			printf("ch = %c\nASCII value = %d",ch,ch);
		}

Ans.10 :- To convert decimal to binary number, divide the number by 2 and write the remainders of each division in reverse order ; this reverse order is its binary equivalent.
	    To convert binary to decimal number, multiply the corresponding binary digit by the power of 2, starting from 0 from right most digit. The sum of the obtained numbers is
		its decimal equivalent.
